## Max Tools for CFW

If you're looking for the Max-based CFW tools previously used to install the custom firmware or manage palettes, they've all been deprecated.

Please use [Launchpad Firmware Utility](https://fw.mat1jaczyyy.com) with the `Launchpad Pro (CFW)` option instead to flash the firmware, and the Palette Utility in the Firmware Utility to download and upload palettes.
